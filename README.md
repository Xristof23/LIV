This is going to be the website for "LOVE IS VIOLENCE", a musical project. So there will be music of the good kind, in this case dark electronic rock with influences from noise, new wave, dark wave and more, maybe even krautrock

And of course love is NOT violence. It is the opposite. But this is about love being some kind of elementary, primal force which can do lot - for better or for worse. By the way, "LOVE IS THE OPPOSITE OF VIOLENCE" did not sound that good to me.
