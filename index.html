        <p>
          "LOVE IS VIOLENCE" is a musical project. It is some kind of dark
          electronic rock with influences from noise, new wave, dark wave and
          more, maybe even krautrock. There are vocals and real electric guitars
          (YEAH!) in it, but also sequenced stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's an old project which was started years ago and slept for a long
          time. So this is kind of a resurrection...
        </p>
        <p>
          And of course love is NOT violence. It is the opposite. But this is
          about love being some kind of elementary, primal force which can do
          lot - for better or for worse. By the way, "LOVE IS THE OPPOSITE OF
          VIOLENCE" did not sound that good to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          And of course lorem ipsum is NOT violence. It is something completely
          different. But this is about lorem ipsum being some kind of
          elementary, nerdy force which can do lot - for better or for worse. By
          the way, "LOREM IPSUM IS THE OPPOSITE OF VIOLENCE" did not sound that
          good to me.
